2.W.A.J.P to read 10 integer values using Scanner class from keyboard. Generate the exception if
the entered value is less than 10 and or greater than 40. Program should display appropriate message
as and when this exception occurs otherwise it will display all the entered values.

4.All the banks operating in India are controlled by RBI. RBI has set a well-defined guideline (e.g.
minimum interest rate, minimum balance allowed, maximum withdrawal limit etc) which all banks
must follow. For example, suppose RBI has set minimum interest rate applicable to a saving bank
account to be 4% annually; however, banks are free to use 4% interest rate or to set any rates above
it. Write a JAVA program to implement bank functionality in the above scenario and demonstrate the
dynamic polymorphism concept. Note: Create few classes namely Customer, Account, RBI (Base
Class) and few derived classes (SBI, ICICI, PNB etc). Assume and implement required member
variables and functions in each class.
